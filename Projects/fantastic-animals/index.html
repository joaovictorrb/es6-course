				<h2>Fox</h2>
				<p>
					Foxes are small to medium-sized, omnivorous mammals belonging to several genera of the family Canidae. 
					Foxes have a flattened skull, upright triangular ears, a pointed, slightly upturned snout, and a long bushy
					tail (or brush).
				</p>
				<p>
					Twelve species belong to the monophyletic "true foxes" group of genus Vulpes.
					Approximately another 25 current or extinct species are always or sometimes called foxes; 
					these foxes are either part of the paraphyletic group of the South American foxes, or of the outlying group,
					which consists of the bat-eared fox, gray fox, and island fox. Foxes live on every continent except Antarctica.
					By far the most common and widespread species of fox is the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) with about 47 recognized subspecies.
				</p>
				<p>
					The global distribution of foxes, together with their widespread reputation for cunning,
					has contributed to their prominence in popular culture and folklore in many societies around
					the world. The hunting of foxes with packs of hounds, long an established pursuit in Europe,
					especially in the British Isles, was exported by European settlers to various parts of the New World.
				</p>
			</section>

				<h2>Squirrel</h2>
				<p>
					Squirrels are members of the family Sciuridae, a family that includes small or medium-size rodents.
					The squirrel family includes tree squirrels, ground squirrels, chipmunks, marmots (including groundhogs),
					flying squirrels, and prairie dogs amongst other rodents. Squirrels are indigenous to the Americas, Eurasia,
					and Africa, and were introduced by humans to Australia.
				</p>
				<p>
					The earliest known fossilized squirrels date from the Eocene epoch, and among other living rodent families,
					 the squirrels are most closely related to the mountain beaver and to the dormice.
				</p>

				<h2>Brown Bear</h2>
				<p>
					The brown bear (Ursus arctos) is a large bear species found across Eurasia and North America.
					In North America, the populations of brown bears are called grizzly bears. It is one of the largest
					living terrestrial members of the order Carnivora, rivaled in size only by its closest relative, the
					polar bear (Ursus maritimus), which is much less variable in size and slightly bigger on average.
				</p>
				<p>
					The brown bear's range includes parts of Russia, Central Asia, China, Canada, the United States,
					Hokkaido, Scandinavia, the Balkans, the Picos de Europa and the Carpathian region (especially Romania and Bulgaria),
					Iran, Anatolia, and the Caucasus. The brown bear is recognized as a national and state animal in several European
					countries.
				</p>
				<p>
					While the brown bear's range has shrunk, and it has faced local extinctions, it remains listed as a least concern
					species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) with a total estimated population in 2017
					of 110,000. As of 2012, this and the American black bear are the only bear species not classified as threatened
					by the IUCN.
				</p>
				<p>
					Populations that were hunted to extinction in the 19th and 20th centuries are the Atlas bear of North Africa
					and the Californian, Ungavan and Mexican populations of the grizzly bear of North America. Many of
					the populations in the southern parts of Eurasia are highly endangered as well. One of the smaller-bodied
					forms, the Himalayan brown bear, is critically endangered, occupying only 2% of its former range and threatened
				  by uncontrolled poaching for its body parts.[13] The Marsican brown bear of central Italy is one of several
					currently isolated populations of the Eurasian brown bear and is believed to have a population of just 50 to 60 bears.

				<h2>Gray Wolf</h2>
				<p>
					The wolf (Canis lupus[a]), also known as the gray wolf or grey wolf, is a large canine native to Eurasia
					and North America. More than thirty subspecies of Canis lupus have been recognized, and gray wolves, as 
					colloquially understood, comprise non-domestic/feral subspecies. The wolf is the largest extant member of 
					Canidae, males averaging 40 kg (88 lb) and females 37 kg (82 lb). Wolves measure 105–160 cm (41–63 in) in 
					length and 80–85 cm (31–33 in) at shoulder height. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The wolf is also distinguished from other Canis species by its less pointed ears and muzzle, as well 
					as a shorter torso and a longer tail. The wolf is nonetheless related closely enough to smaller Canis 
					species, such as the coyote and the golden jackal, to produce fertile hybrids with them. The banded fur 
					of a wolf is usually mottled white, brown, gray, and black, although subspecies in the arctic region may 
					be nearly all white.
				</p>

				<h2>Baboon</h2>
				<p>
					Baboons are primates comprising the genus Papio, one of the 23 genera of Old World monkeys. 
					There are five species of baboons, commonly known as hamadryas baboon, Guinea baboon, olive baboon, 
					yellow baboon and chacma baboon. Each species is native to one of five areas of Africa and the hamadryas 
					baboon is also native to part of the Arabian Peninsula. Baboons are among the largest non-hominoid 
					primates and have existed for at least two million years.
				</p>
				<p>
					Baboons vary in size and weight depending on the species. The smallest, the Kinda Baboon, 
					is 50 cm (20 in) in length and weighs only 14 kg (31 lb), while the largest, the chacma baboon, 
					is up to 120 cm (47 in) in length and weighs 40 kg (88 lb). All baboons have long, dog-like muzzles, 
					heavy, powerful jaws with sharp canine teeth, close-set eyes, thick fur except on their muzzles, 
					short tails, and nerveless, hairless pads of skin on their protruding buttocks called ischial callosities 
					that provide for sitting comfort. Male hamadryas baboons have large white manes. Baboons exhibit sexual 
					dimorphism in size, colour and/or canine teeth development.

				<h2>Lion</h2>
				<p>
					The lion (Panthera leo) is a species in the family Felidae and a member of the genus Panthera. It has a 
					muscular, deep-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. 
					It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions have a prominent mane. With a typical head-to-body length of 
					184–208 cm (72–82 in) they are larger than females at 160–184 cm (63–72 in). 
				</p>
				<p>
					It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion pride consists of a few adult males, 
					related females and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large 
					ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities 
					occur and have been known to hunt humans, the species typically does not.
				</p>
				<p>
					Typically, the lion inhabits grasslands and savannas, but is absent in dense forests. It is usually 
					more diurnal than other big cats, but when persecuted it adapts to being active at night and at twilight. 
					During the Neolithic period, the lion ranged from Central Asia, Southeast Europe to Africa, but today it 
					has been reduced to fragmented populations in sub-Saharan Africa and one critically endangered population 
					in western India. It has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1996 because populations in 
					African countries have declined by about 43% since the early 1990s. Lion populations are untenable outside 
					designated protected areas. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and 
					conflicts with humans are the greatest causes for concern.
